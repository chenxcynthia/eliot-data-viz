# Visualizing Connections in Eliot House üêò 
_An artistic data visualization of the connections made between individuals in Eliot House at Harvard University._

[Eliot House](https://eliot.harvard.edu/), one of the twelve residential houses at Harvard, is a special place for all who know it. From the bustling dining hall packed with students working on problem sets together until the wee hours of morning, to the familiar friendly faces of the house staff, Eliot is a welcoming home of unity among diversity. As a resident of Eliot from 2021 to 2024, I have made some of my closest and most cherished relationships on campus through Eliot, and I will always be grateful for what the tight-knit house community has given me.

As someone interested in using data visualization to draw out patterns at scale, I was curious to see whether I could visualize and portray the essence of the Eliot house community. In my piece, I sought to capture the diversity of student backgrounds, the coming together of people with different interests, and the plethora of connections that Eliot House has fostered.

Some questions I grappled with in this process were:
- How I capture the essence of the diversity and intellectual breadth of students in Eliot?
- What is the best way to show connections between students visually?
- How can I encode personal student information (e.g. hometown, concentration, class) while maintaining data privacy and anonymity?

This project was completed as part of the Eliot Community Artist Fellowship. Many thanks to all the Eliot students who participated in the data collection survery and to Anne Lheem, Stephanie Paulsell, and Andi Wright for their support. If you have any thoughts or questions on this work, I'd love to hear from you (my email is cynthiachen@college.harvard.edu)!
